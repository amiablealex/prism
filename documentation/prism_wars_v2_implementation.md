## üìù Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Backup Your Current Game

```bash
cd ~/prism-wars
cp -r . ../prism-wars-backup
```

### Step 2: Replace Backend Files

Replace these files with the new versions provided above:

1. **game_logic.py** - Replace entirely with the new version
2. **app.py** - Keep your existing file (no changes needed)
3. **lobby_manager.py** - Keep your existing file (no changes needed)

```bash
# In your prism-wars directory
# Replace game_logic.py with the new content
nano game_logic.py
# (Paste the new game_logic.py content, save with Ctrl+O, exit with Ctrl+X)
```

### Step 3: Replace Frontend Files

Replace these files:

1. **static/js/game.js** - Replace entirely
2. **static/css/game.css** - Replace entirely
3. **templates/game.html** - Replace entirely

```bash
# Replace JavaScript
nano static/js/game.js
# (Paste new content)

# Replace CSS
nano static/css/game.css
# (Paste new content)

# Replace HTML template
nano templates/game.html
# (Paste new content)
```

### Step 4: No Additional Dependencies

Good news! No new Python packages are required. The game uses only the existing dependencies.

### Step 5: Test the Changes

```bash
# If running development server
python3 app.py

# If running production with systemd
sudo systemctl restart prismwars
```

### Step 6: Verify Everything Works

Visit `http://your-pi-ip:5000` and test:

1. ‚úÖ Create a new game
2. ‚úÖ Check that you see the new Splitter piece (‚úÇÔ∏è) in inventory
3. ‚úÖ Check that Prism count is now 1 (not 8)
4. ‚úÖ Try to place a piece in the pink/red protected zones near light sources - should be blocked
5. ‚úÖ Look for golden 2x amplifier tiles on the board
6. ‚úÖ Check the objectives panel on the right sidebar
7. ‚úÖ Check the score breakdown shows Territory/Combos/Objectives
8. ‚úÖ Place some pieces and verify light penetrates first blocker
9. ‚úÖ Try using the new Splitter piece - should split into 2 perpendicular beams

## üéÆ Gameplay Changes Summary

### What Players Will Notice

**Immediate Visual Changes:**
- Golden "2x" squares scattered on the board
- Pink protected zones near light sources (can't place pieces there)
- New Splitter piece in inventory
- Only 1 Prism available (precious!)
- Score display now shows breakdown with progress bars
- Objectives panel showing your 2 secret goals

**Gameplay Feel:**
- **Less Defensive** - Can't instantly block opponents' light sources anymore
- **More Strategic** - Need to carefully use your 1 Prism
- **Goal-Oriented** - Players have secret objectives to work toward
- **Dynamic Scoring** - Territory alone isn't enough, combos and objectives matter
- **Clearer Win Condition** - Race to 75 points instead of vague "most territory"

### Strategy Tips for New Version

1. **Protect Your Light Sources** - The 2-cell buffer helps, but place blockers beyond that
2. **Use Prism Wisely** - You only get 1! Make it count for area control
3. **Splitters for Precision** - Use splitters when you need targeted splits
4. **Hunt Amplifiers** - Those golden 2x tiles are worth fighting for
5. **Watch Objectives** - Keep your secret goals in mind when placing pieces
6. **Build Combos** - Try to chain mirrors for bonus points
7. **First Blocker Is Free** - Your light penetrates one blocker, so don't over-defend

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Game won't start after update

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check for Python errors
sudo journalctl -u prismwars -f

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart prismwars
```

### Issue: Objectives not showing

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
- Verify static/js/game.js was updated correctly

### Issue: Splitter piece not appearing

**Solution:**
- Verify game_logic.py has the new 'splitter' piece type
- Check that pieces_per_player includes 'splitter': 6
- Start a NEW game (old games won't have splitter)

### Issue: Protected zones not working

**Solution:**
- Verify game_logic.py includes `_create_protected_zones` method
- Check that `protected_zones` is in the game state
- Look for pink zones on the board - if visible but still allowing placement, check the validation in `place_piece`

### Issue: Scores seem wrong

**Solution:**
- Check that `calculate_detailed_scores` is being called
- Verify amplifier tiles are being counted with 2x multiplier
- Ensure objectives are being checked in `_calculate_objectives`

### Issue: Old games still running with old rules

**Solution:**
All active games use the old rules. You need to:
- Finish old games or leave them
- Start NEW games to get the updated rules
- Optional: Clear old game data:
  ```bash
  rm ~/prism-wars/data/games/*.json
  ```
