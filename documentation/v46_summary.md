# Prism Wars v4.6 - Changes Summary

## 🎯 What Changed in v4.6

### ⚖️ Balance & Mechanics

- Perfect center for "Dominate Center" objective
- Center cells now: (7,7), (8,7), (7,8), (8,8)
- Quadrants perfectly split at row/col 8

### 🎨 UI Improvements

**2. Consolidated Left Sidebar**
- **Before:** Separate "Scores" and "Players" panels

- Shows: Player name, color, status, score, breakdown, progress bar
- More compact, less scrolling

**3. Relocated Objectives & Combos**
- **Before:** Objectives and Combos on right sidebar
- **After:** Both moved to left sidebar (under Scoreboard)
- Right sidebar now: Actions → Inventory → Visual Controls → Legend
- Better information hierarchy

- **After:** Shows potential points ("+5" for mirrors, "+3" for prism)
- Only shows actual points when achieved
- Matches objectives display style

**5. Mirror Chain Detection Fixed**

- **After:** Traces actual light beam paths
- Now correctly detects 3+ mirrors in a single beam
- Combo triggers properly

**6. Center Zone Visual Indicator**
- Subtle gold dashed border around center 2×2
- Shows which cells count for "Dominate Center" objective
- Always visible, non-intrusive
