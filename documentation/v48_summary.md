### ðŸŒ€ New Piece: Portal Pairs

**Teleportation Mechanic:**
- Place portal pairs on border edges (not corners)
- Cost: 6 energy for the pair
- Quantity: 1 pair per player
- Two-step placement: Place first portal, then second portal, turn ends after second
- Light entering one portal exits the other

**Portal Direction Rules:**
- Light exits portal in the SAME direction it entered
  - Enter going down â†’ exit going down
  - Enter going right â†’ exit going right
  - Simple and intuitive!
