## Version 4.8 - Portal Pairs (2025-10-05)

### ðŸŒ€ New Piece: Portal Pairs

**Teleportation Mechanic:**
- Place portal pairs on border edges (not corners)
- Cost: 6 energy for the pair
- Quantity: 1 pair per player
- Two-step placement: Place first portal, then second portal, turn ends after second
- Light entering one portal exits the other

**Portal Direction Rules:**
- Exit direction depends on which wall the EXIT portal is placed on:
  - Top edge â†’ beam exits downward
  - Bottom edge â†’ beam exits upward
  - Left edge â†’ beam exits rightward (east)
  - Right edge â†’ beam exits leftward (west)
- Entry direction doesn't matter
- Bidirectional: Light can enter either portal

**Strategic Use:**
- Teleport beams across the board
- Reach distant amplifier tiles
- Create unexpected territory claims
- Cannot be picked up once placed
- Other players' light can also use your portals

**Visual Design:**
- Swirling gradient effect in player's color
- Portal ring with inner swirl animation
- Color-coded to owner (no need for numbering)

### UI Updates
- Portal Pair (ðŸŒ€) added to inventory
- Cancel Portal button appears during portal placement
- Legend shows Portal Pair (âš¡6)
- Border-only placement restriction enforced
